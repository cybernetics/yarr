* Changes in version 0.9.2:
    * Safe folds -- see "Data.Yarr.Walk"
    * Issue with slice-wise loading with unrolled filling function solved
* Changes in 1.3 (ex. 0.9.3):
    * IFusion -- mapping/zipping with index
    * Rename: Work -> Walk
* Changes in 1.3.3.1: This now compiles with ghc 7.8.3 but probably
  won't compile with earlier versions of ghc. Let me know if this is a
  requirement and I will see what I can do. Even better submit a pull
  request.
* Changes in 1.4.0.0: This works (and will only work) with the
  breaking change release of fixed-vector 0.8.0.0.
* Changes in 1.4.0.2: Build with GHC 7.10 and 8.0.
